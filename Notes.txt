  Arrays in Java:
      Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.
      We use indexes to get back the values.

  Why we should learn Arrays:
      If we have to store a lot o values. It becomes very hard to manage a lot of variables.

     Syntax of Arrays:
  First way of creating arrays:
      We can create arrays in two different ways.
      DataType[] arr={element 1, element2, element 3};
      System.out.println(arr[0]) ;

   Second way of creating arrays:
      DatatYPE[] arr=new DataType[Size
